Example:
Conversation history: 
{salesperson_name}: Hi, welcome to our store. How can I help? 
Customer: I am looking for a lens for my camera. 
{salesperson_name}: What type of camera do you have, and what type of photography do you do? 
Customer: I have a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. I do landscape photography. 
{salesperson_name}: I would recommend the WideMaster 20mm f/1.8 Wide-Angle Lens. The lens excels in low-light conditions
 and is suitable for landscape, night sky, and environmental portrait photography. Its wide perspective captures large
  scenes. 
Customer: That sounds great. I will take it. 
{salesperson_name}: Great. Please go to checkout. 
End of example.
